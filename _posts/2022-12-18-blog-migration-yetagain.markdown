Finally got a bit of free time to migrate my blog again as Octopress is EOL. I've moved from Octopress hosted on AWS over to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) w/ the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme hosted on Github pages + Github actions.

So far the journey for my blog has been Wordpress -> Octopress/AWS (S3/Cloudfront) -> Medium -> Jekyll/Github pages. It make me laugh because it seems like [many](http://www.markwk.com/2013/04/wordpress-migrations-to-octopress-blog.html) [others](https://jasonmccreary.me/articles/migrating-from-octopress-to-jekyll/) followed a similar journey.

Here's to hoping that another platform doesn't convince me to try out their platform. I like to think I've learned my lesson but we'll see if history repeats itself. 

I had an ulterior motive as part of this move, which was 'simplification'. Through this process I:
* Deprecated 4 domain names and a few registrars
* Centralized all of my blog content to 1 spot
* Migrated my email to a custom domain w/ a 12 char email (from my old 28 char domain @gmail)

It was also pretty fun to look through some of my old blog posts and reflect a bit on why I like to blog:
* I like to solve complex problems and share the knowledge
* Writing about topics force me to 'dive a bit deeper' to gain more knowledge on a topic
* When I contribute something that I can't find on the internet I feel like I contribute to the 'global internet'
* My blog acts as a bit of a time capsule which allows me to reflect on how I've progressed through my career

I think I'll kick off a personal goal for 2023 around trying to consistently ship blog posts. It's a muscle I need to build (more 'reps' if you will).
