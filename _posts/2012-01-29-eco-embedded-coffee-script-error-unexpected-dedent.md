Ran into this error when testing out eco (Embedded Coffee Script) templates.

Parse error on line #: unexpected dedent
(in C:/project/app/assets/javascripts/backbone/templates/dartboard.jst.eco)

Broken code:
```coffeescript
<% if 7 > 3 %>
  teststring
<% end %>
```

Fixed Code:
```coffeescript
<% if 7 > 3: %>
  teststring
<% end %>
```

Notice the **colon**, this is telling coffeescript that the next line is indented. Itâ€™s document here: [https://github.com/sstephenson/eco][1] it had just slipped my mind.
