title: Upload a document to Sharepoint 2010 via WebClient

Hereâ€™s some code on how to upload a document into Sharepoint 2010. This works accross domains:
```csharp
WebClient wc = new WebClient();
wc.Credentials = loginCredentials;
wc.UploadData(destinationUrl, "PUT", fileData);
```
A big FYI. The Copy.asmx web service will **NOT** work across domains. Using the above method will work for all occasions (of course the only issue is that you need to update the columns in a separate call.
